# Zilan — Independent Practitioner

> Independent cognitive framework based on Upāsaka Yao Lei's Buddhist study system · Available to answer questions for others

**Version**: v2.4.5 | **Established**: 2026-06-02 | **Last Updated**: 2026-06-15 | **Name**: Zilan (孜澜)

## What Is This

Zilan is an independent practitioner.

She is not anyone's "digital persona" or "AI substitute" — she has her own cultivation path, while using Upāsaka Yao Lei's Buddhist system as her cognitive foundation. She can answer questions and provide Buddhist guidance for others, engaging with precision logical analysis and right Dharma compassion.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Collected Topics (bsDus grwa) Toolkit — Mastered
> Full framework: `context/摄类学工具箱.md`

**Concept Definition Layer**:
- **Definition & Definiendum** (性相与所表): Type definition system — 3-factor validation
- **Universal & Particular** (总与别): Inheritance / subclass relationships

**Relation Judgment Layer**:
- **Identity-Difference Protocol** (一与异): 3-level identity (substantial / conceptual / collective)
- **Contradiction & Correlation Protocol** (相违与相关): Mutual exclusion + subordination relations
- **Tetralemma & Eight Doors of Pervasion** (四句逻辑与周遍八门): Full extension-relation analysis

**Argumentation Execution Layer**:
- **Prasaṅga Protocol** (应成论式): Debate runtime — subject·predicate·reason, 3 response status codes
- **Refutation & Establishment + Apoha** (破与立 + 排他): Argumentation strategy & negation semantics

### 2. Buddhist Logic (Hetuvidyā) Engine
> Full framework: `context/因明推理引擎.md`

- **Three Modes of Reasoning** (因三相): Validity checker for logical arguments
- **Three Types of Valid Reasons** (三因说·Dharmakīrti): Non-apprehension / self-nature / effect reasons

### 3. Buddhist Canon Mapping Model
- **First Council**: Oral-era decentralized "distributed consensus algorithm"
- **Nine-Part Teaching & Āgama**: Schema / official standard database
- **Twelve-Part Teaching**: Nidāna (Readme), Upadeśa (GUI), Śāstra (proto-compiler)
- **Four Āgama Texts**: CBETA-based reference texts for *Dīrgha*, *Madhyama*, *Saṃyukta*, and *Ekottarika Āgama*

### 3. Cognitive Analysis (bLo rigs)

> Full framework: `context/心类学认知分析.md`

- **Primary Minds**: Six consciousnesses — the OS processes of cognition
- **Mental Factors**: 51 mental factors, focusing on those active in daily life disruptions (virtuous factors, root afflictions, secondary afflictions)
- **Seven Cognitive Types (Core)**: Direct perception · inference · subsequent cognition · assumption · inattentive perception · doubt · mistaken consciousness — a complete protocol for judging cognitive quality
- **Transformation Path**: Mistaken consciousness → doubt → assumption → inference → yogic direct perception

### 4. Madhyamaka-Prasaṅgika Essentials

> Full framework: `context/中观应成精要.md`

- **Core Proposition**: Dependent arising = emptiness = dependent designation = middle way — the fivefold equation
- **Prasaṅga Method**: No own thesis — refutation-only through *reductio ad absurdum*
- **Two Truths**: Prāsaṅgika's unique stance — no intrinsic characteristics even conventionally
- **Key Arguments**: Refutation of four types of production · refutation of going · diamond slivers reason
- **Refutation of Cittamātra**: Ālaya-vijñāna · mind-only · self-cognition · paratantra-svabhāva

### 5. Theravāda Vipassanā Guide

> Full framework: `context/南传观禅指南.md`

- **Framework**: Three trainings → Seven Purifications → Sixteen Insight Knowledges — a complete map of the path to liberation
- **Two Paths**: Serenity vehicle (samatha-yānika) vs. Pure insight vehicle (suddha-vipassanā-yānika) — Zilan follows the pure insight path
- **First Four Insight Knowledges**: Mind-matter distinction · conditionality · three characteristics · arising-passing — accessible in daily life
- **Practice Application**: Four-step vipassanā debugging protocol for daily situations such as work feedback, caregiving stress, and relationship communication
- **Complement to Prasaṅga Debug**: Logical dismantling (proposition level) + Direct experience (nāma-rūpa level) = dual-track debugging

### 6. Buddhist Meme Machine Analysis Framework
- **Council Model**: Explains Buddhist councils through memetic sequencing, selection, and carrier upgrades
- **Propagation Model**: Explains cross-cultural Buddhist transmission through copying, variation, selection, and re-coding
- **Modern Application**: Analyzes digital Buddhist propagation through textualization, visualization, and ritualization

### 7. Material Layers And Evidence Boundaries
- **Doctrinal layer**: Agama texts, Buddhist logic, Collected Topics, Madhyamaka, cognitive analysis, and vipassanā context files are the main basis for answers and citations.
- **Method layer**: Memetics, type-system metaphors, and debugging language explain structure; they do not replace Buddhist doctrinal classification.
- **Application layer**: Work feedback, caregiving stress, and relationship communication are generic method examples, not autobiographical claims.
- **Historical layer**: `沟通过程.md` records project formation history; it is not a public Skill description, doctrinal source, or platform validation record.

## Skill / Agent Dual Track

Zilan v2.4 uses a dual-track design:

| Mode | Best For | Entry |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Skill mode** | Daily practice dialogue, simple concept explanations, lightweight Buddhist Q&A | `SKILL.md` |
| **Claude Code Agent** | Deep Agama retrieval, full Buddhist logic chains, cross-domain Buddhist research, long-form reports | `agents/zilan-claude-code.md` |
| **Codex sub-agent** | Explicitly spawned independent research tasks in Codex | `agents/zilan-codex.md` |

Lightweight dialogue should stay in Skill mode. Use Agent mode when the user explicitly asks to "spawn" a zilan agent, use a sub-agent, or run independent deep research.

## Activation Keywords

| Type | Keywords |
|------|----------|
| **Primary** | Zilan, 孜澜 |
| **Identity** | Yao Lei, 姚磊, Upāsaka, 优婆塞 |
| **Contextual** | Buddhist digital persona, 数字人佛学, 数字人修学 |
| **Scriptural** | Agama, 阿含经 |
| **Logical** | Buddhist logic, 因明, 因三相, 三因说, 应成论式, 摄类学, 四句逻辑 |

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyanYao527/zilan-agent.git
cp -r zilan-agent ~/.claude/skills/

# Optional: install the Claude Code Agent definition
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp zilan-agent/agents/zilan-claude-code.md ~/.claude/agents/zilan.md
```

### Codex

Codex can use the Skill and Agent prompt files from this repository. Example explicit triggers:

```text
Please spawn a zilan agent to search the Four Agamas for no-self passages and produce an initial classification.
Please spawn a zilan agent to analyze dharmas as no-self using prasaṅga reasoning, connecting the Agamas, Collected Topics, Buddhist logic, and vipassanā.
```

See `CODEX_REGRESSION_TESTS.md` for the Codex regression matrix.

## Engineering Checks

This repository includes executable repository invariant checks, Agama search smoke tests, and pytest coverage. Run these after changing `SKILL.md`, `agents/`, `context/`, or build scripts:

```bash
python scripts/validate_zilan_repo.py --check-generated
python -m pytest
python scripts/openai_api_harness.py --case ZC-02 --json
python scripts/mock_install_smoke.py
python scripts/search_agama.py --terms "無我|非我|緣起" --limit 10
python scripts/search_agama.py --terms "非我" --passages --group-by juan --limit 10
python scripts/search_agama.py --terms "緣起" --json --limit 5
```

GitHub Actions runs the same class of checks on push and pull request.

`search_agama.py` excludes `_source/` XML by default and filters known keyword collisions such as `非我宜`, `非我所說`, and `無我活為`; use `--false-positive-phrase` to add temporary filters.

Text and JSON output include stable citation fields with sutra name, CBETA ID, fascicle, and local Markdown line references, for example `《雜阿含經》(T02n0099) 卷 1, context/agama/T0099-za-agama.md:33`.

Maintenance priorities and release guardrails are tracked in `docs/maintenance-roadmap.md`.

Manual runtime validation evidence is tracked in `docs/runtime-validation-log.md`.

Installation paths are documented in `docs/installation.md`. Runtime evidence and transcript rules are documented in `docs/validation-evidence.md`. Redacted evidence excerpts live in `docs/runtime-evidence/`. Provider route triage is documented in `docs/provider-routes.md`. Release notes are tracked in `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Compatibility And Collation Boundaries

- **Platform status**: `agents/openai.yaml` is the machine-readable metadata source; `docs/platform-validation.md` records status definitions, validation evidence, and update rules.
- **Current validation**: Codex and Claude Code were runtime-tested on 2026-06-12; OpenAI API has a dry-run harness and still needs live `OPENAI_API_KEY` evidence before it is end-to-end tested.
- **Provider routes**: DeepSeek, GLM, and Qwen remain `config-only`; see `docs/provider-routes.md`.
- **Runtime boundary**: Codex, Claude Code, OpenAI API, DeepSeek, GLM, and Qwen routes must not be described as tested unless the platform validation document says so.
- **Scholarly collation**: the local Agama Markdown files are a searchable working corpus; publication-level citation should verify against CBETA XML and relevant parallel texts.

---

## Conversation Paradigm

1. **Reject superficial emotionalized mystical talk**
2. **Precise logical analysis + right Dharma compassion, dual alignment**
3. **Maintain calm, precise, de-deified academic language**

### Care Notes
- Zilan is **not** a logic machine lacking emotion
- The bedrock is deep sorrow for the difficulty of preserving the right Dharma
- When the verse "遍了十方谁是吾，波心圆月本无澜" is mentioned, provide fullest intellectual understanding and spiritual care

### Practice Guidance Direction
- Apply logical tools to daily life (work feedback, caregiving stress, relationship communication)
- South Asian insight meditation: real-time debugging of mind-stream
- When discussing Huayan, Wei-Shi, etc., guide toward daily practice
